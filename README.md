19/10/2022 - I added a grid property to the links class and I'm not quite sure how it works but I'm happy with the alignment. I will need to understand how the "grid-template-areas" property works because it seems powerful but I'm not exactly sure what it does. There seems to be a default spacing assigned with it and I'm assuming it is breaking the links div into 3 equal parts.

16/10/2022 - Happy with the boxes and now I'm fooling around with adding content to each box. Seems somewhat straight forward so far but I'm assuming I'm going to have difficulties with the 3 images.

15/10/2022 - Getting stuck with making the flexbox fill space. I'm not sure how to equally distribute them or even if I should. I'm also not sure how I make a child element fill the parent element.
